OpeniBot - Open Source Artificial Intelligence Robot

This is a web design exercise inspired by my passion for robotics. Perhaps one day, this website will become a formal robotics project website. Currently, the content is just practice material, and some images are sourced from the internet. If there are any copyright infringements, please contact me for removal.

I'm working on a fork of the open source robotics project and am currently in the early stages of full exploration. I'd love to meet interested individuals to collaborate on the project.

This website will be permanently open source.
